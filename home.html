    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our wheat straw mug is a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional mugs. It is made from natural wheat straw fibers, which are a byproduct of wheat production, making it a renewable and biodegradable material. The mug features a sleek and ergonomic design that fits comfortably in your hand.</p>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the unique features of our wheat straw mug is its thermal insulation properties, keeping your hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold for longer periods. The natural wheat straw material provides a natural barrier to heat transfer, reducing the need for disposable sleeves or double-walled designs.</p>
    <p>In addition to its environmental benefits, the wheat straw mug is also durable and lightweight, making it perfect for everyday use at home, in the office, or on the go. It is easy to clean and dishwasher-safe and it does not retain odors or flavors from previous beverages, ensuring a fresh taste every time.</p>
